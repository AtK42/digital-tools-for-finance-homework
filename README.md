# Intro
This repo is structured by following the course "Digital Tools for Finance" at UZH in the autumn semester 2022 (see repo: https://github.com/ipozdeev/it-skills-for-research). In the branch "midterm" the files required for the homework is shown. The branch "feature-1" is used for an exercise for the git collab exercises, while the "project" branch is used for the final project which is intended to make use of the numerous tools presented during the lecture.

# Main goal of the project
Influence of different macroeconomic factors on the housing price index in the USA in the last 20 years.

# Project description
Using python, we will conduct an OLS regression to capture the effect of prominent macroeconomic factors such as for example the unemployment rate, consumer price index or inflation on the housing index in the United States for the timeframe from 2002 to 2022. An attempt will be made to get the factors explaining the largest portion of the variance in the housing price index in the US.

# Data
The dataset contains month-wise details about macro-economic factors of the US over two decades from 01/2000 to 06/2022 which shall be used to determine how different factors affect the housing market. Sourced and compiled data from FRED.
