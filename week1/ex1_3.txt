Ex: write a text document describing the steps necessary for a user without superuser privileges to create a cron job on a Linux server that runs every second day at 17:00 executing script "runner.sh 'hello'" (no need to create the job, just describe the steps);

Step 1: give user superuser privileges or equivalent role unless one is only editing one’s own crontab file
Step 2: add command lines (one command per line) to the crontab file telling the system to execute the file “runner.sh” with argument ‘hello’, here one schedules the job (0 17 */2 * * for the minute, hour dom month dow), note that this will cause the job to be executed on two successive days for days with 31 days which could be circumvented in a rather complicated manner if this is of major importance
Step 3: verify crontab changes
