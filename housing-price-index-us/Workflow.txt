Task desription to successfully use the Docker-container created for this research.

1. Clone the branch project of the Git-Repository to your machine (https://github.com/AtK42/digital-tools-for-finance-homework.git)

2. Create an environment variable called: RESEARCH_PATH (should point into the project folder), FRED_API_KEY

3. Add folder structure 'data/raw' into the housing-price-index-us directory

4. Download the data from FRED (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/), using the function displayed in the repository (src/data/get_FRED_data.py)

5. Run the Docker image to create a container

6. Run the command in interactive mode: "docker cd CONTAINER:/app/reports/figures/ RESEARCH_PATH/reports/figures/"

Please note, that the Dockerfile seems faulty. Although quite some time was spent on the creation of the Dockerfile, there was always
one error more to solve. We left the Dockerfile in the project in the way that we thought it should work.
The underlying problem lies in the installation of the right packages, and furthermore the right version of the various packages.
